At least 3 features of my project
1.If you click on the select button,the course names will automatically appear in the course name list in the side bar.
2.If you want to see the total price,total credit hour and remaining credit hour then click on the select button to show the total price, total credit hour and remaining hour of selected course.
3.If your remaining hour is 0 then if you want to add another course it will show you an warning toast message.
4.If anyone click same course more than 1 time then it show an waring toast and he can not add a course which is already selected.
